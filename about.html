                    Abigail Jessica Shaw was born on March 10th, 2009, in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she grew up in the suburbs with her parents and older sister. 
                    As a young child, Abigail loved to explore the woods behind her neighborhood with various friends she made who lived in the area. However, when she entered elementary school, 
                    life got a bit more complicated as she experienced bullying from her classmates due to her “odd hairstyle” and “mismatched” clothing choices. 
                    However, despite the negativity thrown her way at school, there was one place Abigail knew she belonged: Carolina Stars Gymnastics, the gym her parents sent her to for lessons when she expressed an interest in gymnastics at the age of five. 
                    After five years of practice, she secured a place on the Carolina Stars competition team and has been competing every season since.

                    Though Abigail is only fifteen years old, she has many goals for her future and is quite the go-getter. 
                    She makes her own money by doing chores around her parents’ house and occasionally pet-sitting for her neighbors. 
                    She also has an official job in between school years as a summer camp counselor at Carolina Stars.

                    As for her plans post-high school, Abigail aspires to obtain a career in interior design as she “loves the satisfaction of seeing a whole room put together with color and decoration.” 
                    Though Abigail has always had an eye for art and design (as seen in her love of drawing), She didn’t consider interior design until she was thirteen, when her parents gave her the creative freedom to design a new look for her bedroom.

                    Abigail has such a strong, ambitious, and creative spirit, and her friends and family cannot wait to see what she does in the future.
